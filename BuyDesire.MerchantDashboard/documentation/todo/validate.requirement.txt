[suggested by sinh.tran]



Every one please provide:

[1] 1 sample for client-side validation
ex. "UserName" validation need:
    + not null
	+ 6 < length < 20
	+ does not contain: 'test' / 'admin' / 'demo' (black-list)


[2] 1 sample for server-side validation via api
(simulate it, dont have to call real api)
	+ check if email is taken (existed in db)

[3] show how we can reuse it in other views


//hint:
==> every validation functions need to stored in "model" then we can reuse it between "views"
