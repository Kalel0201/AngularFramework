                                <p>The Fancy service ("Fancy" or the "Service") is an e-commerce retail service that helps you customize a website, offer retail merchandise for sale to end users, manage inventory, fulfill customer orders and accept and process credit card, debit card and other types of online payment methods (collectively "payments") from your customers in exchange for your products and services for internet-based transactions ("Card Not Present Transactions" or "CNP Transactions"). The Payment Gateway provides the payment services to you on behalf of Fancy. Neither Fancy nor the designated Payment Gateway is a bank or a money services business ("MSB") nor do they offer banking or MSB services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. In addition, we do not assume any liability for the products or services purchased by and sold to customers using our Service. You will be required to register for a Merchant Account to use the Service. This account allows you to review card transactions that are in the process of settling from Payment Networks (as defined below) and us to your designated settlement bank account.</p>
                                <h3>2. Our Services</h3>

                                    Payment Gateway and Fancy provide the e-commerce tools to enable you to use the Service. We reserve the right to require you to install or update any and all software updates to continue using the Service. The foregoing offering is separate and distinct from the Fancy e-commerce and other services that are provided by Fancy Inc. under separate terms and conditions, which are independent of this Agreement (such services being a "Fancy User Account" and such agreement being the "Terms of Merchant Sale" available at: https://fancy.com/about#terms-merchant).<br /><br />

From time to time, we may make available to you information in your Merchant Account regarding anticipated settlement amounts that we have received on your behalf from the Payment Networks and are being held by us pending settlement. The settlement information reflected in the Merchant Account is for reporting and informational purposes only, and does not create any ownership or other rights in settlement funds, which are provisional credits only, until such funds are credited to your designated bank settlement account. Your authorizations set forth herein will remain in full force and effect until your Merchant Account is closed or terminated.</p>
